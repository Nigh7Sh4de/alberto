# Passive decline

- Every village is prone to gradual decline over time
- Tech (or tall playstyles) can counter this decline (and perserve growth)

# Roads

- Connected cities can share villager pool

-> Add priest to counter decline
-> Add roads project to connect cities
-> Send villagers (over roads) to other cities
